Honey Network Project
====================

HNP is a centralized server for management and data collection of honeypots. HNP
allows you to deploy sensors quickly and to collect data immediately, viewable
from a neat web interface. Honeypot deploy scripts include several common
honeypot technologies, including [Snort](https://snort.org/),
[Cowrie](http://www.micheloosterhof.com/cowrie/),
[Dionaea](https://www.edgis-security.org/single-post/dionaea-malware-honeypot), and
[glastopf](https://github.com/glastopf/), among others.

## Features

HNP is a Flask application that exposes an HTTP API that honeypots can use to:
- Download a deploy script
- Connect and register
- Download snort rules
- Send intrusion detection logs

It also allows system administrators to:
- View a list of new attacks
- Manage snort rules: enable, disable, download


## Installation

- The HNP server is supported on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 16.04, and Centos 6.9.  
- Other versions of Linux may work but are generally not tested or supported.

Install Git

    # on Debian or Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt install git -y
    
Install HNP
    
    $ cd /opt/
    $ sudo git clone https://github.com/ehackify/hnp.git
    $ cd hnp/

Run the following script to complete the installation.  While this script runs,
you will be prompted for some configuration options.  See below for how this
looks.

    $ sudo ./install.sh

## Deploying honeypots with HNP

HNP was designed to make scalable deployment of honeypots easier.  Here are the
steps for deploying a honeypot with HNP:

1. Login to your HNP server web app.
2. Click the "Deploy" link in the upper left hand corner.
3. Select a type of honeypot from the drop down menu (e.g. "Ubuntu Dionaea").
4. Copy the deployment command.
5. Login to a honeypot server and run this command as root.

If the deploy script successfully completes you should see the new sensor listed
under your deployed sensor list.

## Integration with Splunk and ArcSight

hpfeeds-logger can be used to integrate HNP with Splunk and ArcSight.

#### Splunk


    cd /opt/hnp/scripts/
    sudo ./install_hpfeeds-logger-splunk.sh

This will log the events as key/value pairs to /var/log/hnp-splunk.log.  This
log should be monitored by the SplunkUniversalForwarder.

#### Arcsight


    cd /opt/hnp/scripts/
    sudo ./install_hpfeeds-logger-arcsight.sh

This will log the events as CEF to /var/log/hnp-arcsight.log
